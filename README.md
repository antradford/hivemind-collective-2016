\i This document is in it\'92s infancy, and should be considered a live draft version only. This document will come together over time, and with patience. And repository content. There\'92s no use doing any of this if there\'92s no content.\
\

\b And with Chris W most recently being an arrogant fucking cunt to me for no reason whatsoever, I\'92m gonna have quite a bit of time to work on projects and get content happening.
